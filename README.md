# Coats Mellon Operational Specification

CMOS first appeared in a Dr Dobb's Journal article back in 1995. Thereafter it appeared in another article 4 years later in 1999.

A practical approach to analyze and flesh out sketchy application requirements, the ideas and methodology behind CMOS is still relevant today as it was back then.

Though both articles can still be found on the archive site of Dr Dobb's Journal, some of the image links were broken.

In this repository, I've converted both articles into PDF format for easier reading.
